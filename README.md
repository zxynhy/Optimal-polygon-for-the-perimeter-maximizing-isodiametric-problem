# Optimal polygon for the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem
Generate all optimal convex $m$-gons in $\mathbb{R}^2$ for the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem and all optimal frames consisting of $m$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$ for the stability of phase retrieval.<br>
<br>
Definition:<br>
- Perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem: Among all convex $m$-gons with fixed diameter, which ones has the maximal perimeter?
- Optimal polygon: A convex $m$-gon is defined as optimal if it is a solution to the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem.
- Optimal frame: A frame consisting of $m$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is defined as optimal if its condition number for phase retrieval attains the minimal value among all frames consisting of $m$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
